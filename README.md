**Project Overview****:-**
The Mental Health and Lifestyle Dataset Analysis project aims to explore and analyze the relationships between various lifestyle factors and mental health indicators, particularly focusing on happiness scores. The dataset contains information on various aspects of individuals' daily lives, including age, sleep hours, work hours, screen time, social interactions, and gender, which are all factors that could influence mental well-being.

**Objectives****:-**
The main objectives of this project are:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain a deep understanding of the dataset by exploring the basic structure, summary statistics, and distributions of key features.

Correlation Analysis: Identify relationships between numerical variables and explore how they might impact happiness scores.

Age Grouping: Categorize individuals into age groups to understand how age impacts mental health, particularly happiness.

Feature Importance Analysis: Use machine learning (Random Forest) to identify which lifestyle features (e.g., sleep hours, screen time, social interactions) are most important in predicting happiness scores.

Clustering: Apply unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering) to identify patterns in the dataset and group individuals based on their lifestyle and mental health attributes.

**Key Features Analyzed****:-**
Age: The age of the individuals in the dataset.

Sleep Hours: Number of hours an individual sleeps on average.

Work Hours per Week: Weekly work hours.

Screen Time per Day (Hours): Average time spent on screens daily.

Social Interaction Score: A subjective measure of social interaction.

Happiness Score: A subjective rating of an individual’s happiness.

**Methodology****:-**
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and formatted to ensure the analysis is accurate, including handling missing values, categorical data encoding, and feature scaling.

Exploratory Analysis: The data is analyzed using statistical methods and visualizations such as heatmaps, pairplots, and boxplots.

Feature Importance: A Random Forest Regressor model is applied to assess which factors most strongly predict happiness.

Clustering: K-Means clustering is used to group individuals based on their lifestyle features and explore if distinct clusters exist.

**Key Insights Expected****:-**
Through this project, we aim to uncover valuable insights such as:

How sleep, work, screen time, and social interactions influence mental health.

Whether certain age groups experience different happiness levels or face different challenges.

The most significant lifestyle factors that contribute to an individual’s happiness.

Potential clusters of individuals with similar mental health and lifestyle profiles.

**Tools and Technologies****:-**
The project makes use of the following tools and technologies:

Python for data analysis and modeling.

pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing.

matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.

scikit-learn for machine learning and clustering techniques.



**Conclusion****:-**
This project successfully demonstrated the power of data analysis in understanding mental health. By leveraging machine learning models, statistical analysis, and visualizations, we were able to uncover meaningful patterns and insights that highlight how lifestyle factors contribute to happiness. These insights can inform future interventions aimed at improving mental health and well-being, whether through promoting better sleep habits, encouraging social interaction, or managing screen time.
